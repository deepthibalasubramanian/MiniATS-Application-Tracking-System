CREATING ENVIRONMENT:
INSTALL ANACONDA
ADD ANACONDA (scripts and condabin) TO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

& "C:\Users\deept\anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe" create -p venv python==3.10 -y
(above cmd creates venv folder)


CREATE REQUIREMENTS.TXT FILE


ACIVATE CONDA ENVIRONMENT
IN ANACONDA PROMPT AS ADMINISTRATOR,
conda init powershell
(now the path in powershell appears like):
(d:\Application Tracking System\venv) PS D:\Application Tracking System>  

conda activate venv/ 

pip install -r requirements.txt


CREATE GOOGLE API KEY
go to makersuite and get a key 
add the key to .env

CREATE APP.PY 
(add the code)


Back to powershell:
streamlit run app.py

(this will launch the app on web localhost)

Now the app will work successfully!
